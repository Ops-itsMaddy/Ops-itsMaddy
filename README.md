Hey there 🙋‍♂️

Hi, I'm Manav 
I’m a student working toward becoming an AI/ML engineer. I'm big on consistency - I try to get some code down or learn something new every single day.

Right now, I’m building end-to-end machine learning projects and diving deep into the math that makes models work. I’m currently sharpening my skills in Machine Learning and trying to ship new features to my repos daily.

🛠 Tools I use
Languages: Python

AI/ML: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pygame

General: Git, GitHub, VS Code

Fun Facts

Hobbies: Gym, anime, Sports 
I like Dogs
Tea and Coffee Both
